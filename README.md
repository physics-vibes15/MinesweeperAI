# Minesweeper AI: Single-Point + CSP Solver

This project implements an **AI agent that plays Minesweeper** using:

- **Phase 1:** Classic *single-point strategies* (two local logic rules)  
- **Phase 2:** A **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**–based intelligent guessing module

It was developed for **CS 271P: Intro to AI** as a game-based project.
